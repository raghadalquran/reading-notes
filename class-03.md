- There are **three types** of HTML lists: *ordered*, *unordered*, and *definition*. 
1. Ordered lists use numbers. 
2. Unordered lists use bullets.
3. Definition lists are used to define terminology.
- Lists can be nested inside one another
  
## Chapter 13 ##
- CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box. 
- You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.
- Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance:
1. Border 
2. Margin
3. Padding
- It is possible to hide elements using the display and visibility properties.
- Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
- Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of boxes containing text and the leading.
- CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders.
- If you specify a width for a box, then the borders, margin, and padding are added to its width and height.
