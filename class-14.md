# SUMMARY #

## Transitions & Animations ##
- Animations within CSS3 allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes. 
- Transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes.
- The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.
- **The transition property has three values:** 
1. The properties to transition (in our case all of them).
2. The speed of the transition (in our case 0.3 seconds).
3. A third value which lets you change how the acceleration and deceleration is calculated, but weâ€™ll stick with the default by leaving this blank.

## Transforms ##
- The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.
- The transform property accepts a handful of different values. The rotate value provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees. Using a positive value will rotate an element clockwise, and using a negative value will rotate the element counterclockwise. 
- Using the scale value within the transform property allows you to change the appeared size of an element.
