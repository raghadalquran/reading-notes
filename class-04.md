## HTML & CSS Book ##

### Chapter 4 ###

- Links are created using the <a> element. 
- The  < a > element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.
- If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
- You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field.
- You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.

### Chapter 15 ###
- <div> elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
- float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
- Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
- Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
- Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
- CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
- You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

### Article ###
#### How does pair programming work? ####
- While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles:
1. The Driver. 
2. The Navigator.
**The Driver** is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code.
**The Navigator** uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs.
- Pair programming touches on all four skills: 
developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.


### Chapter 3 ###
####  Programmers use functions, methods, and objects to organize their code. ####
- Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task. 
- Functions can take parameters (information required to do their job) and may return a value.
