# SUMMARY #
  
  ### Chapter 5 ###
- Where an image is placed in the code will affect how it is displayed.
- Here are three examples of image placement that produce different results:
1: before a paragraph The paragraph starts on a new line after the image.
2: Inside the start of a paragraph The first row of text aligns with the bottom of the image.
3: In the middle of a paragraph The image is placed between the words of the paragraph that it appears in.
- Where you place the image in the code is important because browsers show HTML elements in one of two ways:
1. Block elements always appear on a new line. 
2. Inline elements sit within a block level element and do not start on a new line.
- There are three rules to remember when you are creating images for your website which are summarized below.
1. save images in the right format.
2. save images at the right size.
3. use the correct resolution.
#### You need to know this : ####
- The images you use on your website should be saved at the same width and height that you want them to appear on the page.
- The <  img> element is used to add images to a web page.
- You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the content of an image.
- Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs

### Chapter 11 : “Color” ###


- Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue.
- To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.
- There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
- It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).
- CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
- CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.
