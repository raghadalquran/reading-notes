## Chapter 3: “Functions, Methods, and Objects” ##

- Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task. 
- Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required to do their job) and may return a value.
- An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you.
- In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object. 
- Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window. 
- JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as  String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts. 
- Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other).

## Chapter 6: “Tables” ##

- The < table > element is used to add tables to a web page.
- A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created with the < tr > element.
- Inside each row there are a number of cells represented by the <  td> element (or < th > if it is a header).
- You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes. 
- For long tables you can split the table into a < thead >, < tbody >, and < tfoot >.

- Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem. And a domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate your understanding of that problem.

- Here's some tips to follow when building your own domain models.

1. When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
2. Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
3. Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
4. Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
5. Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
6. Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.
