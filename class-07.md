# SUMMARY #
## Chapter 3: “Functions, Methods, and Objects” ##

- Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task. 
- Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required to do their job) and may return a value.
- An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you.
- In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object. 
- Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window. 
- JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as  String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts. 
- Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other).
