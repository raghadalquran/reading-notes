## Docs for the HTML <canvas> Element & **Chart.js** ##

- At first sight a < canvas > looks like the < img > element, with the only clear difference being that it doesn't have the src and alt attributes.
- Indeed, the < canvas > element has only two attributes, width and height. These are both optional and can also be set using DOM properties.
- When no width and height attributes are specified, the *canvas* will initially be 300 pixels wide and 150 pixels high.
- The element can be sized arbitrarily by CSS, but during rendering the image is scaled to fit its layout size:
- if the CSS sizing doesn't respect the ratio of the initial canvas, it will appear distorted.
- The < canvas > element can be styled just like any normal image (margin, border, backgroundâ€¦). 
- When no styling rules are applied to the canvas it will initially be fully transparent.
