#### Text ####
- HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
- They also provide semantic information (e.g. where emphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).
- When creating a web page, you add tags (known as markup) to the contents of the page. These tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the page.
- Some of tags: '< p > , < b > , < i > , < sup > , < br /> , < hr />'  .
*Content management systems and HTML editors such as Dreamweaver usually have two views of the page you are creating: a visual editor and a code view.*
 - Visual editors often resemble word processors. Although each editor will differ slightly, there are some features that are common to most editors that allow you to control the presentation of text.
- Code views show you the code created by the visual editor so you can manually edit it, or so you can just enter new code yourself. 
- Some of semantic markup: '< strong> , < em> , < blockquote> , < q>' .


### Chapter 10 ###
#### Introducing CSS ####
- CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box (and the contents of that box) is presented.
- CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.
- Different versions of css & browser quirks
1. CSS1 was released in 1996 
2. CSS2 followed two years later.
3. Work on CSS3 has been ongoing but the major browsers have already started to implement it.
- Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
- Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties  of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
- CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.


 
## JAVASCRIPT ##

### Chpter 2 ###
- A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe. 
- Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, 
you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value. 
- Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script. 
- Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information. 
- JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), 
strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false). 
- Expressions evaluate into a single value.
- Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value. 

### Chapter 4 ###
- Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next. 
- Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands. 
- Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.
- if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false. 
- switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match). 
- Data types can be coerced from one type to another. 
- All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy. 
- There are three types of loop: for, while, and do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
