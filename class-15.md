# SUMMARY #

**I read about Julia Rozovsky , and her story.**

### Some Notes : ###

- Today’s most valuable firms have come to realize that analyzing and improving individual workers a practice known as ‘‘employee performance optimization’’ — isn’t enough.
- As commerce becomes increasingly global and complex, the bulk of modern work is more and more team-based.
- One study, published in The Harvard Business Review last month, found that ‘‘the time spent by managers and employees in collaborative activities has ballooned by 50 percent or more’’ over the last two decades and that, at many companies, more than three-quarters of an employee’s day is spent communicating with colleagues.
