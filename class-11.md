## HTML book: ##

### Chapter 16: “Images” ###
- Specifying **image sizes** helps pages to load more *smoothly* because the HTML and CSS code will often load before the images, and telling the browser how much space to leave for an image allows it to render the rest of the page without waiting for the image to download.
- Images can be **aligned** both *horizontally* and *vertically* using CSS.
- You can use a **background image** behind the box created by any element on a page. 
- Background images can appear just once or be repeated across the background of the box.
- You can create image rollover effects by moving the background position of an image.
- To reduce the number of images your browser has to load, you can create **image sprites**.
- You can specify the *dimensions* of images using CSS.This is very helpful when you use the same sized images on several pages of your site.

### Chapter 19: “Practical Information” ###
- **Search engine** optimization **(or SEO)** is the practice of trying to help your site appear nearer the top of search engine results when people look for the topics that your website covers.
- SEO is often split into two areas: 
1. **on-page techniques.** 
2. **off-page techniques.**
- Determining which keywords to use on your site can be one of the hardest tasks when you start to think about SEO. 
- Analytics tools such as Google Analytics allow you to see how many people visit your site, how they find it, and what they do when they get there.
- To put your site on the web, you will need to obtain a domain name and web hosting.
- FTP programs allow you to transfer files from your local computer to your web server.
- Many companies provide platforms for blogging, email newsletters, e-commerce and other popular website tools (to save you writing them from scratch).
